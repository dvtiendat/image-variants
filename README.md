# Image Variants
This is a part of Python3 Specialization Course 5 Project. The input is a single image and the task is to print out a contact sheet which contains a total of 9 pictures, and each picture has a different color and intensity. 

I use my own picture (which is a duck :) ) and try to change its color and intensity.

Input: ![duck](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111187020/188606104-0003c2e3-9654-49f6-9c4f-945838d8b636.png)

and the code can print the following output:

By editing the intensity parameters, it can produce more variants of a duck :)
